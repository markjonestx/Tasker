# Tasker - A Rust clone of Taskboard

This is an attempt to reproduce Taskboard functionality using Rust instead
of Javascript. This was done as a chance to learn Rust, as well as to have
a more portable CLI Task app.

Functionally, the two programs should mostly be the same. Any CLI commands
you're used to should be the same on Tasker, though the configuration file
used will be different.

You can also merge your Taskboard configuration to Tasker, details on how
will come in time.
